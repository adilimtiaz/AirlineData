# AirlineData
This project is my first project involving relational databases. This was done as an academic project in a group of four students. 

This project simulates a database that would be used to manage airports. Information about flights, tickets and crew can be manipulated or explored via SQL. The end-user does not need to have any technical skills.

Skills Used:PHP, mySQL, Bootstrap, HTML

Please demo the project at: http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~s9a0b/AirlineData/login.html
